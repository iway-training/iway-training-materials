# File Management

## Files and directories manipulation

* Copy: cp
* Move: mv
* Remove: rm (rmdir when delete directory)
* Permission editing: chmod, chgrp, chown

## Searching:

* find: find by name, path slow, does not need the indexing database
* locate: find by name, path, faster, needs database (update database with
  `updatedb` command)
* grep: find by contents, using regular expression
